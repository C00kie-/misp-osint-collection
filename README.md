# misp-osint-collection

This repository describes a process/best-practices to gather OSINT information (such as public report, blog posts, twitter, information, notes) into a [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org) event. The goal is to ensure that the majority of OSINT gathered information in MISP information sharing communities used similar techniques.
